# Civic Reporting — Demo (Parul University)

A compact, Wikipedia-like web UI for **Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting & Resolution** (demo).
Built for Vadodara Hackathon 6.0 by **Team HackCode**.

## Features (compact)
- Report civic issues (pothole, lights, garbage, water, encroachment).
- Track by Issue ID & phone.
- Live map centered on **Parul University, Vadodara** (Leaflet + OSM).
- CivicBot — quick feature explainer.
- Small impact snapshot chart (QuickChart).

## Run locally
1. Clone or download files.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser (no server required).
3. For hosting, push to GitHub and enable Pages.

## Notes
- This is a **demo** (in-browser, client-side). No backend.
- Reports stored in-memory for the session (not persistent).
- Replace imagery & APIs for production (Google Maps, auth, DB).
