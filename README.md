# 🏙️ Crowdsourced Civic Issue Reporting & Resolution System

A web-based platform to empower citizens to **report civic issues** (potholes, street lights, garbage, water/drainage, encroachment, etc.) with photos, GPS, and descriptions.  
The system routes complaints to the right departments, provides live tracking, and ensures **accountability & transparency**.
